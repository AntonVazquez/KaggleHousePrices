# KaggleHousePrices
Repo for KaggleHousePrices competition, predicting final prices of homes in Ames, Iowa using advanced regression techniques. Includes source code, documentation, and files for result replication. Goal: accurate model creation using provided variables.

This repository was created for the purpose of participating in the Kaggle competition "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques". In this challenge, a dataset is provided which includes 79 explanatory variables that describe almost every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The goal of the project is to predict the final price of each home using advanced regression techniques.

This repository will contain the project source code, along with documentation and necessary files to replicate the results. Regression models will be developed using advanced machine learning techniques and will be tuned using cross-validation techniques to ensure model generalization.
